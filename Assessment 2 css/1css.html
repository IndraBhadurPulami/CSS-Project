            <h2>Desuup Indra Bhadur Pulami</h2>
             
                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Desuup Indra Bhadur Pulami.</strong> I belongs to the dragon country name <b>BHUTAN.</b> <i><u>My village is Jachhu(MUGA), Gewog Gakidling under the Sarpang Dzongkhag.</u></i>
                </p>

                <p>
                   I have completed class 12. I have took a commerce in 11 and 12 but could not qulified for further studies as I was not that good in studies, but also i managed to get a job in one of the biggest company called FMCL in the Bhutan as a PoL Manager, in contract. I had done work for 2 years but I was not that happy to contune to do job.
               </p>
               <p>
                    After resigning from FMCL I came back to my village and help my parents untill I joined Desuup. While I was in village COVID-19 pandemic hit world. Immediately our government decide to train youth as a <strong>Desuup (GUARDIAN OF PEACE)</strong> for country benefits as well as for jobless youths. So, I also planned to join as a Desuup to serve the country. IT was a great oppertunity for me to serve the country. As a Desuup I had gained lots of experience and got chance to study as per my interest. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had got an opportunity to do <strong><i><u>ICT foundational course</u></i></strong> as a Desuup from <b><ins>DSP(Desuung Skilling Program)</ins></b>. It was a great opportunity for all Desuup who has a interest in various skilling. Those who has a interest can apply for course as per their interested skill. So, I thank our great King for this oppertunity and if given a chance I will serve our King, County and People(Tsa Wa Sum).
